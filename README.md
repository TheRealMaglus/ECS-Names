Requires Selenium Microsoft Edge driver to be located in current working directory.
This currently only supports Windows Microsoft Edge driver
Due to reliance on Microsoft Edge, also requires Edge to be installed alongside the driver(installed by default on new Windows 10 and Windows 11 versions)

You can get the official edge driver exe file at
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/

Please drag and drop this into working directory of jar or the project
